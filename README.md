In the era of big data, companies like Nestle are leveraging advanced analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights from their extensive datasets. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of two prominent machine learning approaches - Ensemble Learning and Supervised Learning - in analyzing Nestle's data. By evaluating their performance, scalability, and interpretability, we can provide valuable insights into which method may be more suitable for specific analytical tasks.
Ensemble Learning:
Ensemble Learning involves combining multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance. Techniques like Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forest fall under this category. In the context of Nestle's data analysis, Ensemble methods can help reduce overfitting and enhance predictive accuracy, making them potentially valuable tools for complex datasets.
Supervised Machine Learning:
Supervised Learning involves training a model on labeled data to make accurate predictions or classifications on unseen data. Algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Neural Networks are commonly used in this approach. Supervised Learning provides interpretable insights, making it suitable for tasks where understanding the underlying factors is crucial.
